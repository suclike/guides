# Oath

For seven years and counting, Gil Yehuda, Senior Director of Open Source at Oath (which owns the Yahoo and AOL brands), has led the open source program at Yahoo. Currently, he is gearing up to "double the program." The company’s formal open source program office, now eight years old, serves as a hub to connect all things related to open source, he says, but it didn’t start out that way.

Like at many other companies, it started informally with a group of diligent engineers and a few legal people. But the growing ad hoc group soon realized it needed a more formal program if it was going to be able to scale to address more issues and achieve specific business goals.

The top five of Oath’s numerous open source goals, according to Yehuda, are: 

1. Keep the company aligned with others on de facto technology standards.
2. Prevent creating unique and expensive tech stacks that Oath alone would have to manage at its own expense. 
3. Make it extremely easy for company engineers to interact with open source as users or as contributors. 
4. Become an open source friendly company. 
5. Become a great place for engineers to work.

Scaling both work and goals requires the right tools. Yehuda says at Oath they proactively listen to the needs of their engineering teams, track requests in Jira, and post things on GitHub.

> "We also have custom tools that help with checking on code and on projects, but we’re hoping to work more with our peers in the [TODO Group](http://todogroup.org) on tooling we can share across many of our peer open source program offices," he said.

Oath chose to weave metrics and management into their processes along the way.

> "Much like having an enterprise code repo, consistent approach to build, test, and deploy, and a set of resources to help with performance and security, we need to manage our open source process. Once in place, we look at getting the most benefit from process," Yehuda said.

> "We strive to avoid getting locked into costly tech debt situations. And we strive to have people tell us they joined the company because they knew of our open source culture."

### What success looks like

Yahoo helped make [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) what it is today. Without Hadoop, big data wouldn’t have become the major business driver it is now. Even so, big data strained engines as the need for real-time data, aka streaming data, grew. So, the Yahoo team created S4 only to ditch it later in favor of the more advanced Storm. 

> "We applied to [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) what we learned from Hadoop and S4," Yehuda said. “Our goal was to make it great, even though it kind of competed with our own first stab.” 

Storm is a success today, and the company runs it alongside Hadoop to power many of its products. 

> "We’ve leveraged our expertise with Storm to help both Caffe and TensorFlow achieve better scalability. We don’t own these solutions exclusively. Rather we share our code and help others -- all the while we get to leverage our expertise to build one of the industry’s most scalable platforms for our use," he said. “This saves us money while making us a fantastic place to work on projects that impact hundreds of millions of people.”

The program office worked on strategy, legalities, and execution of these and similar projects. Leveraging open source licensing and processes effectively was a key element throughout. 

Yehuda cited three key lessons he has learned as a program manager: 

1. Act like a service.
2. Accept the challenges will be never-ending. 
3. And, there is no such thing as too many relationships; build them all.

> "Sure, the licenses are what they are, and we know what they mean," he said. “Yet, there are so many edge cases that come up -- partnerships, acquisitions, unclear contract terms -- and we simply need to be open to learn, explore, and come up with an answer. "Consider all the horizontal services your company provides and try to connect with them all -- helping each other be better horizontal services for all groups," said Yehuda.
